# Domain Preset · Contract Identifier

Generates a contract identifier by hydrating the built-in `contract` preset. This gives you production-ready separators and compartments with one option.

## Run

```bash
node code_samples/domain-presets/generate-contract-id/sample.js
```

## What it demonstrates

- Passing `preset: 'contract'` to the constructor.
- Showing that the preset stores its name on `generator.configuration.preset`.
