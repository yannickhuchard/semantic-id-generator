# TypeScript Tooling · Builder Pattern

Reuses the builder pattern from the docs but isolates it into a runnable script. Perfect for teams that want to construct configurations fluently.

## Run

```bash
node --import ./scripts/register-ts-node.mjs code_samples/typescript-tooling/builder-pattern/sample.ts
```

## What it demonstrates

- Building a strongly typed configuration.
- Generating an ID once the builder assembles the separators and compartments.
